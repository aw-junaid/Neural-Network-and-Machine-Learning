The basic building block of a neural network is the **neuron**, also known as a **node** or **perceptron**. Neurons are the fundamental units of computation in a neural network. They receive input, process it, and produce an output.

Here are the key components of a neuron:

1. **Input**:
   - Neurons receive input from one or more sources. These inputs can be the features of the data in a given problem.

2. **Weights**:
   - Each input is associated with a weight. These weights represent the strength of the connection between the input and the neuron. They determine how much influence each input has on the neuron's output.

3. **Summation**:
   - The weighted inputs are summed together. This sum takes into account the strength of each connection.

4. **Bias**:
   - A bias term is added to the sum. The bias is a constant value that allows the neuron to adjust its output independently of the inputs.

5. **Activation Function**:
   - The result of the summation (plus the bias) is then passed through an activation function. This function introduces non-linearity into the model. It transforms the input into a format that can be interpreted by the next layer of the network.

6. **Output**:
   - The output of the neuron, after passing through the activation function, becomes the input to the next layer of neurons.

The choice of activation function is crucial, as it determines the type of non-linearity introduced into the network. Common activation functions include the sigmoid, tanh, ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit), and softmax (used in the output layer for multi-class classification).

In a multi-layer neural network, neurons are organized into layers: an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. Each layer consists of multiple neurons, and the neurons in one layer are connected to all the neurons in the previous and subsequent layers.

By organizing neurons into layers and adjusting the weights and biases, neural networks can learn to approximate complex functions and make accurate predictions or classifications on new data. This basic unit, the neuron, is replicated and connected to form the powerful computational structure of a neural network.
