Neural networks have found applications across a wide range of fields due to their ability to learn complex patterns from data. Here are some of the prominent applications of neural networks:

1. **Image and Video Recognition**:
   - Neural networks, especially Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), are used for tasks like object recognition, image classification, and video analysis. They are widely used in applications like facial recognition, autonomous driving, and medical imaging.

2. **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**:
   - Neural networks are used for various NLP tasks such as sentiment analysis, machine translation, named entity recognition, and language modeling. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Transformers are popular architectures for NLP tasks.

3. **Speech Recognition**:
   - Neural networks, particularly Recurrent Neural Networks and their variants, are used in speech recognition systems, enabling applications like voice assistants, transcription services, and voice-controlled devices.

4. **Anomaly Detection**:
   - Neural networks can be used to detect anomalies or outliers in data, making them valuable in applications like fraud detection, network security, and fault diagnosis in industrial processes.

5. **Recommendation Systems**:
   - Neural networks are employed in recommendation engines to provide personalized suggestions for products, content, or services. They analyze user behavior and preferences to make accurate recommendations.

6. **Medical Diagnosis**:
   - Neural networks are used in medical image analysis for tasks like detecting tumors, classifying diseases, and analyzing medical scans. They help improve diagnostic accuracy and assist healthcare professionals.

7. **Autonomous Vehicles**:
