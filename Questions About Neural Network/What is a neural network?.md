A neural network is a computational model inspired by the structure and functioning of the human brain. It's a fundamental concept in machine learning and artificial intelligence.

At its core, a neural network consists of interconnected nodes, often referred to as "neurons." These neurons are organized into layers, typically comprising an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer.

Here's a brief overview of these components:

1. **Input Layer**: This layer receives the initial data or features and passes them on to the next layer. Each node in the input layer represents a feature or attribute of the data.

2. **Hidden Layers**: These are intermediate layers between the input and output layers. They process the input data through a series of weighted connections and activation functions. The "hidden" part means that these layers are not directly observable from the outside and are where the network learns to extract features and patterns from the input data.

3. **Output Layer**: This layer produces the final output or prediction based on the processed information from the hidden layers. The number of nodes in the output layer depends on the nature of the problem. For example, in a binary classification task, there might be two nodes representing the two classes.

Each connection between neurons is associated with a weight, which determines the strength of influence one neuron has on another. During the training process, these weights are adjusted based on the error (the difference between the predicted output and the actual target) through a process called backpropagation.

Additionally, each neuron has an associated activation function, which introduces non-linearity into the network. This allows the neural network to learn and represent complex relationships in the data.

The strength of neural networks lies in their ability to automatically learn from data without being explicitly programmed. Through a process called training, neural networks adjust their internal parameters (weights and biases) to minimize the difference between their predictions and the actual targets. This is done by using an optimization algorithm (e.g., gradient descent) along with a loss function that quantifies the prediction error.

Once trained, a neural network can make predictions or decisions on new, unseen data.

There are many different types of neural networks, each designed for specific tasks. Some common types include feedforward neural networks, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image-related tasks, and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for sequential data.

Neural networks have been instrumental in achieving state-of-the-art results in various fields such as computer vision, natural language processing, and many other areas of artificial intelligence.
