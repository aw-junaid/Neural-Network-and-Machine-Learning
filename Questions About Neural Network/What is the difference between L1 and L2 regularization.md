**L1 and L2 regularization** are techniques used to prevent overfitting in machine learning models, including neural networks. They achieve this by adding a penalty term to the loss function, which discourages the model from relying too heavily on any single feature.

Here are the key differences between L1 and L2 regularization:

### L1 Regularization (Lasso):

1. **Penalty Term**:
   - L1 regularization adds a penalty term proportional to the absolute value of the weights: \( \lambda \sum_{i=1}^{n} |w_i| \).

2. **Effect on Weights**:
   - It tends to drive some weights all the way to zero, effectively removing some features from the model.

3. **Sparsity**:
   - L1 regularization promotes sparsity in the weight matrix, meaning it encourages the model to use only a subset of features.

4. **Feature Selection**:
   - L1 regularization can perform feature selection by setting the weights of less important features to zero.

5. **Use Case**:
   - L1 regularization is particularly useful when you suspect that only a subset of features are relevant for the task.

### L2 Regularization (Ridge):

1. **Penalty Term**:
   - L2 regularization adds a penalty term proportional to the square of the weights: \( \lambda \sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i^2 \).

2. **Effect on Weights**:
   - It discourages the weights from becoming too large, but it doesn't tend to drive them all the way to zero.

3. **Weight Shrinking**:
   - L2 regularization "shrinks" the weights towards zero, but generally doesn't set them exactly to zero.

4. **Balanced Impact**:
   - It is useful when you believe that all features are somewhat relevant, but you want to avoid any one feature having too much impact.

### Combined (Elastic Net):

1. **Penalty Term**:
   - Elastic Net combines both L1 and L2 regularization, adding a term that is a mixture of the absolute values and squares of the weights: \( \lambda \left( \alpha \sum_{i=1}^{n} |w_i| + (1-\alpha) \sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i^2 \right) \).

2. **Balance Between Sparsity and Weight Control**:
   - It allows for a balance between sparsity (feature selection) and controlling the size of the weights.

3. **Use Case**:
   - Elastic Net can be a good default option when you're unsure which form of regularization is best.

### Summary:

- **L1 Regularization** encourages sparsity and can perform feature selection by setting some weights to zero.

- **L2 Regularization** helps prevent any one feature from having too much influence, but doesn't typically lead to exact zeros.

- **Elastic Net** combines the benefits of both L1 and L2 regularization, providing a balanced approach.

The choice between L1, L2, or a combination of both depends on the specific characteristics of the data and the problem at hand. It's often determined through techniques like cross-validation.
