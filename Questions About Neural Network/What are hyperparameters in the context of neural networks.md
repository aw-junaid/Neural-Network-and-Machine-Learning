In the context of neural networks, **hyperparameters** are configuration settings that govern the behavior of the model during the training process. Unlike the parameters (weights and biases) which are learned from the data, hyperparameters must be set prior to training and are not learned from the data. Choosing appropriate hyperparameters is crucial for training an effective and well-performing neural network.

Here are some key hyperparameters in neural networks:

1. **Learning Rate**:

   - The step size at which the weights are updated during training. It controls the size of the steps taken in the direction of minimizing the loss function.

2. **Number of Epochs**:

   - An epoch is one complete pass through the entire training dataset. The number of epochs determines how many times the model will see the entire dataset during training.

3. **Batch Size**:

   - The number of training examples used in one iteration (forward and backward pass) of training. A smaller batch size can lead to noisier updates but can also converge faster.

4. **Network Architecture**:

   - This includes the number of layers, the number of neurons in each layer, and the type of activation functions used.

5. **Initialization of Weights**:

   - The method used to set the initial values of the weights before training. Proper initialization is crucial for effective learning.

6. **Regularization Parameters**:

   - Hyperparameters like L1 or L2 regularization strengths, dropout rates, and other techniques used to prevent overfitting.

7. **Optimizer**:

   - The optimization algorithm used for updating the weights. Common choices include stochastic gradient descent (SGD), Adam, RMSprop, etc.

8. **Activation Functions**:

   - The choice of activation functions used in each layer. Common choices include ReLU, sigmoid, tanh, etc.

9. **Dropout Rate**:

   - The rate at which neurons are randomly dropped out during training. This is a regularization technique used to prevent overfitting.

10. **Loss Function**:

    - The function used to quantify the difference between the predicted and actual values. It depends on the specific task (e.g., mean squared error for regression, cross-entropy for classification).

11. **Learning Rate Schedule**:

    - How the learning rate changes over time during training. This can be a fixed schedule, a decaying schedule, or dynamically adjusted based on performance.

12. **Momentum and Nesterov Momentum**:

    - Hyperparameters for controlling the influence of previous updates in optimization algorithms like SGD with momentum.

13. **Batch Normalization Parameters**:

    - Parameters related to batch normalization layers, such as momentum, epsilon, etc.

14. **Weight Decay**:

    - A hyperparameter that controls the amount of weight decay (L2 regularization) applied during training.

15. **Early Stopping Criteria**:

    - The criteria used to stop training early, such as validation loss not improving after a certain number of epochs.

Choosing the right combination of hyperparameters is often a critical part of building effective neural networks. It usually involves a process of experimentation, including techniques like grid search, random search, and model validation, to find the best hyperparameter values for a specific task and dataset.
