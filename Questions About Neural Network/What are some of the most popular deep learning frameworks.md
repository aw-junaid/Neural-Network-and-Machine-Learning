There are several popular deep learning frameworks that provide tools and libraries for building, training, and deploying deep learning models.

1. **TensorFlow**:
   - Developed by Google, TensorFlow is one of the most popular and widely used deep learning frameworks. It provides a comprehensive ecosystem of tools, libraries, and community support. TensorFlow 2.x, the latest version, emphasizes simplicity and ease of use.

2. **PyTorch**:
   - Developed by Facebook's AI Research lab (FAIR), PyTorch has gained immense popularity for its dynamic computation graph feature and user-friendly API. It is known for its flexibility and has a large and active community.

3. **Keras**:
   - Originally an independent high-level neural networks API, Keras has been integrated into TensorFlow as its official high-level API. It provides an intuitive and easy-to-use interface for building and training neural networks.

4. **MXNet**:
   - Apache MXNet is an open-source deep learning framework developed by the Apache Software Foundation. It is known for its efficiency and scalability, making it suitable for both research and production environments.

5. **Caffe**:
   - Caffe is a deep learning framework developed by the Berkeley Vision and Learning Center (BVLC). It is widely used for its speed and efficiency, particularly in image classification tasks.

6. **CNTK (Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit)**:
   - Developed by Microsoft, CNTK is a deep learning framework known for its high performance and scalability. It is designed to train deep learning models efficiently on large datasets.

7. **DL4J (Deep Learning for Java)**:
   - DL4J is a deep learning library for Java and the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). It is designed to integrate seamlessly with Java applications and provides a variety of tools for building and training neural networks.

8. **Theano**:
   - While not as actively developed as some other frameworks, Theano was one of the earliest deep learning libraries and played a significant role in the advancement of the field. It is known for its efficiency and optimization capabilities.

9. **Chainer**:
   - Chainer is a flexible and intuitive deep learning framework that allows dynamic computation graphs. It was developed by Preferred Networks, and its dynamic computation approach makes it particularly suitable for research.

10. **Swift for TensorFlow**:
    - Developed by Google, Swift for TensorFlow aims to combine the flexibility of dynamic languages like Python with the performance of compiled languages. It enables deep learning in the Swift programming language.

These frameworks provide a wide range of tools and support for building and training deep learning models. The choice of framework often depends on factors like the specific task, the programming language preference, the complexity of the model, and the level of community support required. Additionally, it's worth noting that the deep learning landscape is dynamic, and new frameworks and updates to existing ones may have emerged since my last training data in September 2021.
