**Deep learning** is a subset of machine learning that involves the use of neural networks with multiple layers (hence the term "deep"). It's a type of representation learning, where the model learns to represent data in multiple levels of abstraction.

Here are some key characteristics and aspects of deep learning:

1. **Multiple Layers**:
   - Deep learning models consist of multiple hidden layers through which data is processed. Each layer learns to represent the data in a progressively more abstract and complex way.

2. **Feature Hierarchies**:
   - Deep learning allows for the automatic discovery of intricate feature hierarchies in the data. Lower layers tend to learn simple, local features, while higher layers learn more complex, global features.

3. **End-to-End Learning**:
   - Deep learning models are designed to learn directly from raw data. This means that they can take raw input (e.g., pixels from an image) and learn to perform tasks without the need for hand-engineered features.

4. **Non-Linearity**:
   - Deep learning models use activation functions, which introduce non-linearity into the computations. This is crucial for capturing complex relationships in the data.

5. **High-Dimensional Data**:
   - Deep learning is particularly well-suited for high-dimensional data, such as images, audio, and text, where traditional machine learning methods may struggle.

6. **Learning from Big Data**:
   - Deep learning models benefit from large datasets. They have the capacity to learn from massive amounts of data, which is one of the reasons they've been so successful in areas like computer vision and natural language processing.

7. **Challenges**:
   - Deep learning also comes with challenges, including the need for substantial computational resources, a large amount of training data, and careful tuning of hyperparameters.

8. **Architectures**:
   - There are various types of deep learning architectures, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for computer vision, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for sequential data, and Transformers for tasks like language modeling.

9. **Applications**:
   - Deep learning has achieved state-of-the-art performance in a wide range of applications, including image and speech recognition, natural language processing, autonomous vehicles, drug discovery, and more.

10. **Representation Learning**:
    - Deep learning models automatically learn to represent the data in a way that is useful for the task at hand. This is in contrast to traditional machine learning, where feature engineering is often required.

Deep learning has revolutionized many fields within artificial intelligence and has been instrumental in achieving breakthroughs in tasks that were previously considered very challenging. Its ability to learn complex representations directly from data makes it a powerful tool in modern machine learning.
