**Supervised Learning:**

1. **Definition**:
   - Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the model is trained on a labeled dataset, meaning that the input data is paired with the correct output.

2. **Training Process**:
   - During training, the algorithm learns to map the input data to the correct output by minimizing the error between its predictions and the true labels.

3. **Goal**:
   - The goal of supervised learning is to generalize from the training data to make accurate predictions or classifications on new, unseen data.

4. **Examples**:
   - **Classification**: Assigning a label or category to input data (e.g., spam or non-spam emails).
   - **Regression**: Predicting a numerical value (e.g., predicting house prices).

**Unsupervised Learning:**

1. **Definition**:
   - Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning where the model is trained on an unlabeled dataset, meaning that the input data is not paired with any corresponding output.

2. **Training Process**:
   - The algorithm tries to learn patterns and structures from the data without any guidance regarding the correct output.

3. **Goal**:
   - The goal of unsupervised learning is often to discover hidden patterns, group similar data points together, or reduce the dimensionality of the data.

4. **Examples**:
   - **Clustering**: Grouping similar data points together (e.g., customer segmentation for targeted marketing).
   - **Dimensionality Reduction**: Reducing the number of features while retaining as much information as possible (e.g., Principal Component Analysis).

**Key Differences**:

1. **Labeled Data**:
   - In supervised learning, the training data is labeled, meaning it includes both the input data and the correct output. In unsupervised learning, the data is unlabeled, so the algorithm must find structure on its own.

2. **Guidance**:
   - In supervised learning, the algorithm is provided with guidance on how to make predictions based on the labeled data. In unsupervised learning, the algorithm must find its own structure or patterns without any guidance.

3. **Goal**:
   - The goal of supervised learning is to learn a mapping from input to output, allowing the model to make accurate predictions on new data. The goal of unsupervised learning is often to discover hidden patterns or structures within the data.

4. **Examples**:
   - Examples of supervised learning tasks include classification and regression, where the goal is to predict a specific output. Unsupervised learning tasks include clustering and dimensionality reduction, which focus on finding structure or patterns within the data.

5. **Semi-Supervised Learning**:
   - There's also a middle ground called semi-supervised learning, where the dataset is partially labeled. Some data points have associated labels, while others do not. This approach combines elements of both supervised and unsupervised learning.

Both types of learning have their own strengths and are used in different types of applications depending on the nature of the data and the problem at hand.
